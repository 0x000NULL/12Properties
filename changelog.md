### Notes
- Property images are currently using Unsplash URLs (should be replaced with actual property images)

## Security Enhancements - 2024-01-20 14:00 UTC (v0.0.0)

### Added Security Dependencies
- Added `bcryptjs` for secure password hashing
- Added `helmet` for HTTP header security
- Added `express-rate-limit` for DDoS protection
- Added `jsonwebtoken` for secure authentication
- Added `mongoose` for MongoDB interactions
- Added `express-validator` and `express-sanitizer` for input validation
- Added `multer` and `sharp` for secure file uploads
- Added `express-session` with `connect-mongo` for session management
- Added `cors` for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing control
- Added `dotenv` for environment variable management
- Added `cloudinary` for secure image handling
- Added `nodemailer` for email communications
- Added `xss-clean` for XSS attack prevention

### Security Configurations
#### Express Application (`app.js`)
- Implemented Helmet middleware with CSP directives
- Added rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- Configured CORS with whitelist
- Set up secure session management with MongoDB store
- Added input sanitization and XSS protection
- Implemented secure cookie settings
- Added custom security headers
- Enhanced error handling for production environment
- Limited request body size to prevent large payload attacks

#### Server Configuration (`bin/www`)
- Added HTTPS support with modern TLS configuration
- Implemented HTTP to HTTPS redirect in production
- Added secure cipher suite configuration
- Implemented graceful shutdown handling
- Enhanced error handling for both HTTP/HTTPS servers
- Added environment-specific server configurations

#### Environment Configuration
- Created secure environment variable structure
- Added configuration for both development and production environments
- Separated HTTP/HTTPS port configurations
- Added SSL certificate path configurations
- Added session secret and allowed origins settings

### Security Rationale
- **HTTPS Implementation**: Ensures all data transmission is encrypted
- **Modern TLS**: Uses only secure, modern cipher suites
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force and DDoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Prevents injection attacks and malformed data
- **Session Security**: Ensures secure user sessions with proper cookie settings
- **Error Handling**: Prevents information leakage in production
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Ensures proper handling of active connections
- **Environment Separation**: Maintains different security levels for development/production

### Breaking Changes
- HTTP traffic redirects to HTTPS in production
- Stricter content security policy
- Rate limiting may affect high-frequency API users
- Requires SSL certificates in production
- Requires MongoDB for session storage

### Notes
- SSL certificates must be properly configured in production
- Environment variables must be set before deployment
- MongoDB connection required for full functionality
- Some security features are environment-specific
