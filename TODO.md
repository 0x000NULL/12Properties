## Implementation Guidelines

### Testing Requirements
- Create security test cases for each improvement
- Test in staging environment before production
- Perform penetration testing after major changes
- Document all security test results

### Documentation Requirements
- Update security documentation after each change
- Document all configuration changes
- Create incident response procedures
- Maintain changelog of security updates

### Monitoring Requirements
- Set up alerts for security events
- Monitor security logs regularly
- Track failed authentication attempts
- Monitor API usage patterns
- Track rate limit violations

### Maintenance Schedule
- Weekly security dependency updates
- Monthly security assessment
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Annual security audit

## Notes
- Prioritize tasks based on risk assessment
- Consider dependencies between tasks
- Document all security changes thoroughly
- Test changes in staging before production
- Keep security dependencies updated
- Monitor security advisories
- Regular security training for team members
- Maintain incident response plan
